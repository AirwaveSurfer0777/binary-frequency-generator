# Frequency Generator

## Overview

The Frequency Generator is a Java-based application that allows users to generate sound frequencies based on binary input. The application features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to enter binary numbers, play corresponding sound frequencies, and stop the sound as needed. This tool can be useful for sound therapy, educational purposes, or simply for experimenting with sound frequencies.

## Features

- **Binary Input**: Enter binary numbers to generate corresponding frequencies.
- **Sound Playback**: Play sound at the specified frequency in a loop.
- **Stop Sound**: Stop the sound playback at any time.
- **User -Friendly GUI**: A simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Customizable Icon**: Set a custom icon for the application window.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frequency-generator.git
   cd frequency-generator
Open the Project: Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

2. Add Resources: Ensure that you have an icon image file named icon.png in the src/resources directory. This icon will be used for the application window.

3. Build the Project: Compile the project using your IDE's build tools.

Usage
Run the Application: Execute the Main class to launch the Frequency Generator.

Enter Binary Input: In the input field, enter a binary number (e.g., 1000010000 for 528 Hz).

Play Sound: Click the "Play Sound" button to generate and play the sound at the specified frequency.

Stop Sound: Click the "Stop Sound" button to stop the playback.

View Output: The application will display the binary input and the corresponding frequency in the GUI.

Example
Binary Input: 1000010000
Frequency Output: 528 Hz
